Atlanta United’s playoff hopes came crashing down in a match that had everything – nine goals, a dramatic comeback attempt, defensive meltdowns, and gut-wrenching disappointment at the final whistle. In front of their home crowd at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the Five Stripes endured a nightmare opening half before nearly pulling off a stunning recovery in the second. Ultimately, the 5–4 defeat confirmed their elimination from the 2025 MLS Playoffs.

### First Half: A Collapse of Historic Proportions ###

The first 45 minutes will go down as one of the worst halves in Atlanta United history. Columbus controlled the tempo from the opening whistle, punishing nearly every lapse in concentration. The Crew struck first in the 15th minute when Rossi pounced after Hibbert rushed off his line, and just two minutes later, Atlanta were cut apart again on the counter. By the 25th minute it was 3–0, with Ali left unmarked for a simple tap-in. Before fans could process the scoreline, Herrera made it 4–0, and Rossi completed his hat trick in the 39th minute.

Atlanta looked shell-shocked. The backline was repeatedly pulled out of position, with Mihaj and Gregersen losing runners in the box. The midfield, anchored by Muyumba and Alzate, turned the ball over in dangerous areas, gifting Columbus easy chances. While the attack showed flashes – Brennan’s energy, Thiaré’s movement – the team could not finish from open play. A penalty earned by Thiaré and calmly converted by Almirón gave the hosts a sliver of hope at 5–1 heading into halftime, but the crowd knew the damage had already been done.

### Deila’s Halftime Gamble ###

Manager Ronny Deila faced a decision in the locker room: leave things as they were and avoid embarrassment, or roll the dice with bold changes. To his credit, he chose the latter. Deila made three substitutions and shifted Atlanta into a three-center back formation, sacrificing Hernández and Brennan while introducing Lennon and Reilly. The switch revitalized the team in a way few could have expected.

The halftime talk also seemed to strike a nerve. Players came out with fire, pressing higher, moving quicker in possession, and showing the bravery Chris Henderson had demanded pre-match. Within seconds of the restart, Amador rose to head home and cut the deficit to 5–2. Thiaré, who had been lively all night, produced a brilliant finish in the 73rd minute to make it 5–3. Just 10 minutes later, he added another, this time with Gregersen providing the assist. Suddenly, the score was 5–4, and belief surged through the stadium.

### Reilly Sparks the Midfield ###

Perhaps the most important figure in the turnaround was Will Reilly. Taking control of the midfield, he dictated the pace, broke up Columbus counters, and joined attacks with confidence. His energy and positioning allowed Alzate to play a simpler role, while freeing Almirón to push forward and orchestrate in attack. Unfortunately, Reilly’s return from injury was short-lived; he went down again late in the match and was replaced by Cooper, who impressed on his MLS debut.

Gregersen also redeemed himself after a shaky first half. He became an unlikely attacking outlet, nearly scoring and setting up Thiaré’s second. Meanwhile, Mihaj and Berrocal steadied the defense, finally limiting Columbus to speculative chances. Hibbert, who had picked the ball out of his net five times in the first half, stood tall to prevent the scoreline from growing worse.

### The Final Push ###

The closing stages were filled with tension and raw emotion. With eight minutes of stoppage time signaled, Atlanta surged forward in waves, desperate to complete the comeback. Almirón and Saba both fired narrowly off target, Gregersen nearly bundled home from a set piece, and Thiaré kept pressing despite hobbling after a knock. Every clearance from Columbus was met with groans, every Atlanta chance with roars of belief. The Crew goalkeeper, already cautioned for time-wasting, was under siege but managed to hold firm. As the final whistle blew, Atlanta players dropped to the turf in exhaustion and heartbreak, knowing they had left everything on the field yet still came up one goal short.

### By the Numbers ###
- 9 goals scored in total, a season-high spectacle for neutral fans.
- 5 first-half goals conceded, the worst 45-minute stretch of Atlanta’s 2025 campaign. Maybe ever.
- 2 goals for Thiaré, his best performance of the season.
- 1 first half hat trick for Columbus star Diego Rossi.
- 0 playoff chances remaining for Atlanta United.

### Standout Performers ###
- Thiaré – Two goals, tireless movement, and perhaps his strongest performance in an Atlanta shirt. His late injury is cause for concern.
- Will Reilly – Controlled the second half and nearly dragged Atlanta back into the match. His injury status will be monitored closely.
- Almirón – Calmly converted his penalty and drove the attack with leadership and urgency.
- Defensive unit (2nd half) - locked down the backline keeping Columbus from getting another

### Subpar Performances ###
- Defensive unit (first half) – Left gaping holes that Columbus exploited mercilessly.
- Muyumba – Multiple giveaways that led to chances, struggling to find rhythm.
- Mihaj and Gregersen (first half) – Poor positioning allowed free runs and open headers before they regrouped after the break.

### Looking Ahead ###

The Five Stripes’ elimination marks the end of their playoff ambitions in 2025, but the final 45 minutes offer glimpses of what could be. Players like Reilly, Cooper, and Thiaré showed fight, while Deila’s tactical switch proved he has ideas for the future. The coming weeks will be about evaluation – who deserves to be part of the 2026 rebuild, and who has run out of chances. For now, Atlanta fans are left with frustration at what might have been, and a lingering sense of pride at the response that almost produced one of the greatest comebacks in club history.
