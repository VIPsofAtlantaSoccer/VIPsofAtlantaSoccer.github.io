This was not a competitive fixture.  The score did not matter.  The result did not matter.
This was a scrimmage, in the clearest sense of the word. Tata Martino used that exact term after the match, and it fit what unfolded on the pitch.

The two teams had never played each other before. This was Atlanta United’s first preseason scrimmage of 2026. It was Lexington’s second. The match featured an almost complete lineup change at halftime.

Players were rusty.  First touches were not match-ready.  Player runs did not always align. None of that mattered.

---

## So what was the point

This match existed to test how players are absorbing Tata Martino’s instructions under conditions that training cannot replicate.

The staff were watching interactions rather than outcomes.
How players moved off the ball. How quickly they recognized space. Whether runs complemented each other or conflicted. Whether communication increased as pressure rose.

Most importantly, they were looking for intent.
Did players attempt to follow new directives, even when execution failed? Did they adjust in real time? Did they behave like a group rather than a collection of individuals?

## Unavailable Players

- Latte Lath – hip
- Saba Lobjanidze – adductor
- Jay Fortune – still recovering from foot surgery
- Jamal Thiáre – under the weather

Without latte Lath and Thiáre unavailable, Tata chose to start with Miranchuk as striker.  Cayman Togashi took over that role in the second half.
Tata was asked about this decision post game.  Had Latte Lath been available, he would have started at striker, with Miguel Almirón on the left and Miranchuk on the right.

## The 1st 45'

Starting lineup
- GK: Lucas Hoyos
- Back line: Pedro Amador, Juan Berrocal, Enea Mihaj, Ronald Hernández
- Midfield: Steven Alzate, Tristan Muyumba, Tomás Jacob
- Front line: Luke Brennan, Alexey Miranchuk, Miguel Almirón

Lexington were the more organized side early. They communicated loudly, controlled long stretches of possession, and initially looked more likely to score.

Atlanta's first group of players showed an emphasis on structure and experimentation. Tata is clearly making tactical changes to the team.

The back line played much higher than it did last season.  Center backs regularly stepped beyond the halfway line. They played as a back four with both fullbacks advancing aggressively. This approach will demand recovery speed and coordination across the back line as the season progresses.

Interestingly, the two wingbacks operated differently.  On the right, Ronald Hernández pushed high and wide, overlapping on the outside. On the left, Brennan hugged the touchline. Pedro Amador overlapped on the inside, frequently appearing in central attacking midfield areas or higher.  Amador often moved opposite the phase of play. Rather than recovering immediately, he stayed high. His positioning suggested a readiness to serve as a counterattacking outlet rather than reset defensively.

Lucas Hoyos was not the same constant vocal presence that Brad Guzan had been. His communication was quieter and more targeted. When he spoke, it was to identify marks and alert defenders to opposing runners, not to direct the line continuously. He did not act as a cheerleader or a central organizer.  That responsibility fell primarily to Enea Mihaj, who was the most vocal presence along the back line and handled the majority of in-game organization.

Lucas Hoyos generally had a quiet half. With the biggest scare being a Lexington shot that struck the underside of the bar. Hoyos was well beaten on the  shot as he didn't get much height on his jump.  His involvement was otehrwise limited. He did not operate as a sweeper and stayed closer to his net.  One notable sequence came on a goal kick played along the ground through the middle to Enea Mihaj, who immediately came under pressure and was forced to deal with it quickly.

Tomás Jacob was deployed as a defensive midfielder. Tata Martino has expressed a preference for Jacob at right back.  With the club still evaluating options to replace Bartosz Slisz, Martino used the scrimmage to assess Jacob’s comfort and decision-making in a midfield role.  Jacob is familiar with those responsibilities, having played the position previously at Newell’s Old Boys.

The attacking group was less vocal than the defense. Communication relied more on coordinated movement and hand gestures than on verbal cues. There were few instances of players calling for the ball.  Based on how consistently it appeared, this seemed intentional. By limiting cues, attackers forced defenders to pick up runs later, giving a slight edge in reaction time.

The opening goal came in the 11th minute. Luke Brennan beat his defender, drew two more toward him, and delivered a cross into the box. Alexey Miranchuk arrived centrally and finished the chance.

To their credit, Lexington maintained control for much of the opening 30 minutes. Their organization held even after conceding, and they continued to dictate tempo. That control began to fade only after Atlanta found its second goal.

The buildup to that goal was direct and well-timed. Miguel Almirón received the ball under pressure and flicked it into Miranchuk’s path. Almirón immediately continued his run upfield. Miranchuk returned the pass into space, where Almirón had separated from his mark. He took a touch, looked up, and finished cleanly.

Atlanta got their third five minutes later.  Amador was playing in a central midfield position when he received the ball.  He passes to a surging Almirón who took a no-look shot for the goal.

In the 42nd minute, Miguel Almirón played the ball wide to Pedro Amador. Amador drove a low cross across the six-yard box, just beyond Luke Brennan’s reach. The ball carried through to Alexey Miranchuk, who finished with a controlled back-post touch using his left foot.

## The 2nd 45'

Starting lineup
- GK: Jayden Hibbert
- Back line: Dominik Chong-Qui, Juan Berrocal, Stian Gregersen, Matt Edwards
- Midfield: Cooper Sanchez, Will Reilly, Adrián Gill
- Front line: Santiago Pita, Cayman Togashi, Enzo Dovlo

Substitutions
- Majub Majub for Berrocal
- Adyn Torres for Edwards

This half was both more aggressive and less orderly.  Atlanta pushed higher, with center backs stepping past midfield and fullbacks advancing earlier.

The language on the field shifted primarily to English, and the tone changed with it. Jayden Hibbert was immediately more vocal than Hoyos, organizing the back line in both English and Spanish. He could be heard frequently yelling to the front line.  

There was a moment of concern early on when Stian Gregersen was seen limping off the ball for a few minutes.  He recovered and appeared to shake it off, again highlighted the ongoing question of his durability.  When he's on the pitch, he's really good, and this was no different.  He played a prominent role in buildup, repeatedly attempting long, line-breaking passes over the top and narrowly missing Cayman Togashi on multiple runs.  He covered ground well, making several clearances he had no business getting to.  

Will Reilly looked physically stronger than last season. He went into challenges decisively and covered ground with purpose. In several duels, he used his body to knock back opponents and consistently arrived in strong defensive positions.

Adrián Gill was deployed as a defensive midfielder. He operated deeper than Tomás Jacob had in the first half and focused on screening space rather than joining buildup. Despite being smaller in stature, he used his body well in challenges and held his ground in contact.  Gill stayed compact, closed passing lanes, and prioritized defensive positioning over forward movement.  Late in the game, Adrián Gill took a hit to his right knee and went to ground. His response was notable given the length of time he missed following his ACL injury. After getting back up, he continued to run and engage physically, showing no reluctance to challenge opponents despite visible discomfort. 

On the left, Dominik Chong-Qui and Santiago Pita overlapped frequently. Pita delivered a solid performance, finding space and staying involved in buildup. Chong-Qui worked hard down the flank and arrived in good positions, but his final delivery was inconsistent.

On the right, Matt Edwards stayed deeper. He often opted to move the ball forward quickly rather than overlap, feeding passes into Enzo Dovlo. Dovlo looked comfortable playing one-touch and keeping sequences moving. Edwards was substituted after roughly 20 minutes.  Given his injury last season, the change appeared precautionary.  

Adyn Torres entered in his place.  He settled in without incident and kept his role simple.

Majub Majub replaced Juan Berrocal at center back. He had little to do, as play rarely progressed into his area during his time on the pitch.

## Press Conference

Postmatch, Tata Martino described the match as a useful early test rather than a finished product. He noted that the group has been working together for roughly two weeks and said some of the concepts emphasized in training were already visible, even if execution remained uneven. He characterized the performance as a good starting step while stressing that there is still significant work ahead.

Martino also pointed out that Lexington entered with more preseason minutes, having played Orlando City earlier in the week. He felt that context made the scrimmage a valuable first experience for Atlanta. He added that the team will now travel to Texas for the next phase of preseason against stronger opposition.

When asked specifically about the first half, Martino focused on decision-making and timing rather than effort. He emphasized that the staff is prioritizing how players combine in close areas, particularly under pressure and within tight spacing. Those details, he said, require repetition and are still being developed.

Martino addressed the positional relationships between wingers and fullbacks, reinforcing that the asymmetry seen during the match was intentional. On the right side, with Miguel Almirón drifting inside more frequently, the fullback was instructed to provide width. On the left, Luke Brennan remained wider, allowing Pedro Amador to step inside and participate centrally. Martino framed those movements as part of an ongoing effort to improve combinations and decision-making among nearby players.



Asked about Santiago Pita, Martino said that although he started on the left wing, he was not instructed to remain fixed in that position. Instead, he was encouraged to find space and move freely within the attacking structure, reflecting an emphasis on flexibility rather than rigid positioning at this stage of preseason.

Martino was also asked about moments when Lexington played in behind the back line. He framed that less as a concern about individual speed and more as a collective issue. He emphasized the importance of applying better pressure to the ball, particularly against long passes, noting that improved first-line defending would allow the back line to handle those situations more effectively.

## The Takeaway

Last season, there was open uncertainty about whether Almirón and Miranchuk could function together centrally.  They operated together consistently and effectively. Both were comfortable receiving under pressure. They sought each other out in tight central spaces, rotated positions rather than occupying the same space, and combined quickly to break lines.  With the two of them playing centrally, and wingbacks surging up the pitch, it has the potential to unlock Latte Lath.

Will Reilly looked physically stronger and went into challenges decisively, controlling midfield.  Adrián Gill handled a deeper role with positional discipline and used his body well in contact. The contrast between Gill and Reilly presents a midfield pairing worth monitoring as preseason continues.

Enea Mihaj functioned as the primary defensive organizer, handling most of the communication and line management.

Overall, this scrimmage served its purpose.

Lexington’s early organization provided resistance. Atlanta adapted and asserted themselves. 

Nothing here causes concern. Nothing here offers guarantees.  But as a first look at 2026, it was engaging, organized, and active. 

And it wasn't boring.
