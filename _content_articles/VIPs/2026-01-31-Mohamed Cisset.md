Atlanta United 2 have signed 21 year-old defender Mohamed Cisset ahead of the 2026 MLS NEXT Pro season.

Cisset joins the club following his professional debut year with **North Texas SC**, where he established himself as a regular starter. The signing adds a young centerback with recent MLS NEXT Pro experience as ATLUTD2 enter their ninth season of competition.

## Mo Cisset

Born in Montréal, Cisset holds both **Canadian** and **Malian** citizenship. He stands 6'2" and primarily operates as a centerback.

His development pathway began in the United States. Cisset spent four years at Montverde Academy’s SIMA program, one of the country’s most competitive prep environments. He later joined Penn State University, where he became a consistent starter across multiple seasons.  While there, Cisset made more than 30 appearances and earned recognition as a *Big Ten Player to Watch*, reflecting his defensive reliability and comfort in possession.

Cisset was selected 71st in the 2025 MLS SuperDraft by FC Dallas. He signed with their MLS Next Pro affiliate, **North Texas SC**, and stepped immediately into a starting role.

During the 2025 season, he recorded:

- 21 appearances, including 20 starts
- 1,653 minutes played
- 1 goal
- 25 clearances, leading the team
- ~89 percent pass accuracy

He was relied upon to defend space, win first contact, and maintain possession under pressure rather than operating as a purely reactive defender.

quote="Mo is a talented left-sided defender that brings a lot of ability on the ball and aggressiveness without it.  He’s a leader, somebody you can count on, and someone we targeted in the MLS draft. At his young age, he brings a lot of maturity and a competitive edge that is pivotal in his position."

The signing provides additional options at centre-back as the club continues to prioritize defenders capable of playing under pressure.
