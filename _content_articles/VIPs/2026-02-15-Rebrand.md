Since the beginning, this project has operated under one banner: ***ATLUTD VIPs***.  The name reflected its origin. The site began as a focused effort to document Atlanta United - its players, coaches, academy products, transactions, and moments that shaped the club’s early years. What started as match notes and player profiles grew into a structured archive. Timelines. Transfer tracking. Historical mapping. Editorial reporting.  

The original name no longer fully reflected the scope of the coverage.

Beginning now, ***ATLUTD VIPs*** will operate as ***VIPs of Atlanta Soccer***:  [www.VIPsofAtlantaSoccer.com](https://VIPsofAtlantaSoccer.com)

When MLS arrived in 2017 through Atlanta United FC, it marked a turning point for the city. The infrastructure followed.  Atlanta United 2 established its own developmental track. The academy matured into a consistent pipeline. Former Atlanta players surfaced across leagues in the United States and abroad.

And the landscape continues to widen. An NWSL expansion club is scheduled to begin play in Atlanta in 2028, adding a top-flight women’s presence to the city’s professional structure. At the same time, United States Soccer Federation operates from its new headquarters in metro Atlanta, further ensuring that Atlanta is the home to soccer in the US.

This is not a departure from Atlanta United coverage. That remains central. The club’s first team, second team, academy, and alumni pipeline will continue to be tracked with the same detail and structure as before.  

Atlanta’s soccer story was never confined to one crest. It moves through training grounds, reserve matches, academy tournaments, lower-division stadiums, and former players building careers elsewhere. This project will follow those lines where they lead.

The mission continues. The name now matches the scope.
