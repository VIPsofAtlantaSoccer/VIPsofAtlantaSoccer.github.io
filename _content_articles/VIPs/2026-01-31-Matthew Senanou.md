Atlanta United 2 have added a central defender ahead of the 2026 MLS NEXT Pro season, signing Matthew Senanou from Colorado Rapids 2.

Senanou joins on a one-year contract for the 2026 campaign, with a club option for 2027. The 22-year-old arrives after a full professional season in MLS NEXT Pro, bringing experience and immediate availability to Atlanta’s back line.

At six-foot-four, Senanou is a physical presence. His profile, however, extends beyond size. He has shown consistency in possession and comfort operating within a structured build-up.

During the 2025 season with Colorado Rapids 2, Senanou logged regular minutes in central defense. He made 20 appearances, including 15 starts, and recorded a pass completion rate near 89 percent. In a league that increasingly asks defenders to initiate play, that reliability carries weight.

For head coach Jose Silva Caparros, Senanou profiles as a defender who can step into matches without prolonged adaptation. His experience level places him closer to immediate rotation than long-term project.

## The NCAA Path

Senanou played collegiately at two NCAA Division I programs, with the most productive stretch of his career coming at Xavier University.

He began his college career at the **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill** before transferring to **Xavier University**, where he featured prominently over the 2023 and 2024 seasons. In two years with the Musketeers, Senanou appeared in 33 matches and logged 2,139 minutes of action.

During the 2024 season, Senanou led **Xavier** in scoring with three goals from the back line. He finished his collegiate career with four goals across 36 total matches.

Defensively, **Xavier** posted 16 shutouts during Senanou’s two seasons with the program.  Senanou also played a central role in a historic 2023 campaign. Xavier captured the BIG EAST Tournament Title, the first conference championship in program history, and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2014.

In the 2025 MLS SuperDraft, Senanou was selected sixth overall by the Colorado Rapids, becoming the highest draft pick in **Xavier** men’s soccer history.

## Atlanta United 2

By signing Senanou alongside Mohamed Cisset, the club has added two defenders with prior professional minutes to a young defensive group that includes Daniel Chica and Toto Majub. The move increases rotation options across the back line as Atlanta United 2 prepare for the upcoming campaign.
