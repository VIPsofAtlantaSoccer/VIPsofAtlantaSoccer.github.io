Atlanta United have traded forward Jamal Thiaré to the Columbus Crew in exchange for $200,000 in 2026 General Allocation Money and up to $100,000 in conditional 2027 GAM. Thiaré is reportedly under contract with Columbus only for 2026.

The move sends the Senegalese striker to Ohio after two and a half seasons in Atlanta, where he operated as a rotational No. 9 across regular-season and postseason play.

## Columbus adds MLS-tested attacking depth

Columbus moved for Jamal Thiaré after selling Jacen Russell-Rowe, adding an experienced forward to replace outgoing minutes and maintain depth across the striker pool.  The Crew add a veteran forward with playoff experience and a recent track record of MLS minutes.

Thiaré arrives in Columbus with 11 regular-season goals in 2,188 minutes across 57 MLS regular-season appearances for Atlanta United. He also scored two goals in eight postseason matches with the club.

## Atlanta United

Atlanta United used the move to clear a veteran forward slot and open immediate budget space.  Clearing Thiaré’s contract removes a high six-figure salary charge while adding allocation resources that can be deployed elsewhere on the roster.

With the trade complete, Atlanta retains four forwards officially on the senior roster - Latte Lath, Cayman Togashi, Luke Brennan, Ashton Gordon - with Gordon currently on loan with **Chattanooga**. 

With defensive midfield viewed as the roster’s clearest area of need, the club has the option to operate without a traditional third striker. Preseason usage has shown that Almirón and Miranchuk can function in advanced roles without a fixed striker, giving Atlanta tactical flexibility even as forward depth thins. That flexibility creates a pathway to concentrate resources on acquiring a No. 6 rather than adding depth up front.

And for Atlanta supporters, one moment will always stand out - the stolen touch, the empty net, the elation - that will endure.
