Ricky Davey is no stranger to the demands of a high-stakes soccer environment.  After four years spent navigating the youth-to-pro pipeline at Atlanta United, his next challenge will be defined by the community of Dothan, Alabama.

Davey was officially introduced this week as the new head coach of **Dothan United SC**.  The hiring marks a meaningful step for the South Central Division club, which competes in USL League Two.  For those unfamiliar with the landscape, this summer league serves as a critical proving ground for collegiate players and young prospects looking to maintain their amateur status while gaining experience in a competitive national environment.

Davey arrives with a resume built on the foundation of Southeastern soccer development.  During his time with Atlanta United from 2021 to 2024, he led the U14s to two Southeast League titles and a Patterson Cup.  His subsequent work as the U19 head coach and an assistant with Atlanta United 2 gave him a direct hand in shaping the next generation of professional talent.

Most recently, Davey served as the Associate Head Coach at Mercer University, where the Bears earned notable results against programs such as North Carolina and Memphis. His head-coaching capability was also evident during his tenure with the Georgia Revolution in the NPSL. In 2021, he guided that club to its first-ever national tournament appearance and earned Conference Coach of the Year honors.

## Dothan United SC

The Dothan United Dragons have quickly emerged as a standout project in USL League Two.  Since the club’s founding in 2023, the organization has prioritized a professional match-day atmosphere that has helped transform the 10,000-seat Rip Hewes Stadium into an active home environment. Attendance has been a distinguishing feature: an official club report from 2024 noted that nearly 5,000 fans attended one of the Dragons’ early home matches, a figure uncommon at the pre-professional level.

Local support has carried over onto the field. During the 2025 regular season, the Dragons were perfect at home, posting a 6-0-0 record. That momentum helped drive a postseason run that included the Southern Conference Championship and a place in the USL League Two National Semifinals.

>"I think the community, the support is incredible.  For this level of soccer and USL League Two, it’s one of the best in the country.  Seeing it today just puts a seal on it."

Former head coach Carl Reynolds departed this winter for an associate head coaching role at Liberty University. Dothan General Manager Aaron McCreight noted that while the search drew national interest, Davey was the preferred candidate throughout the process. Reynolds assisted in the transition, placing Davey at the top of the shortlist.

## Building the 2026 Dragons

Davey is assembling an entirely new coaching staff for the 2026 season, stating that staff decisions are nearly complete.

He also confirmed that four players from last year’s semifinal squad will return, with additional roster announcements to follow. Davey said that match strategy will continue to vary based on the opponent.

>"I’ve got to prove it all over again come the summer.  But I’m really excited to do that."

The Dragons begin their 2026 campaign in May.
