Atlanta United has signed Tomás Jacob via the U-22 Initiative, acquiring the 21-year-old defender from Club Necaxa. Jacob is under contract through June 2029, with club options for 2030 and 2031.

Jacob is a 21-year-old Argentine defender and a product of Newell’s Old Boys. He broke into Newell’s first team as a teenager and made about 50 senior appearances before a surprise move to Necaxa in July 2025. Newell’s sold him for approximately $2 million while retaining a 20 percent sell-on clause. Less than a year later, Atlanta United is reported to be paying roughly $5 million, reflecting a rapid rise in valuation tied to immediate playing time and his ability to translate across leagues.

After arriving in Liga MX, Jacob earned minutes right away, making 17 appearances for Necaxa. His most recent usage has been primarily at center back, often on the right side of the back line. Earlier in his career at Newell’s, he was deployed across multiple positions, including center back, right back, central midfield, and occasionally in wider or advanced roles.

Statistically, Jacob profiles as a pure defender. FBref data shows him grading above average in tackles and interceptions, challenges attempted, and defensive duels, reinforcing the picture of an active, front-foot defender who steps into space rather than retreating. His passing profile is conservative and functional, favoring short to medium distribution with low progressive passing volume. He attempts few dribbles or carries, and his role is not to advance play through individual action.

Jacob is not arriving as a creative fullback or a ball-dominant center back. His job is to defend, recycle possession, and reset shape. Cards per 90 are something to watch, but are not out of line for his age.

For Atlanta United, the immediate need is at right back, not center back. Atlanta currently has three established starters centrally. On the right, Matt Edwards is young and still developing. Jacob’s background makes him a viable defensive option on the right. His recent minutes have come at center back, but his earlier usage and defensive profile allow him to support that role while also providing central cover if needed.
