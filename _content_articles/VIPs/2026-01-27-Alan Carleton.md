On a dark winter night in Sandviken, a small industrial town of roughly 40,000 about two hours north of Stockholm, daylight fades early and winter settles in hard. In January, temperatures stay below freezing, snow lingers for months, and the rhythms of daily life slow into routine.

At Jernvallen, home of Sandvikens IF, football gives way to winter reality. The pitch where Superettan matches are played in spring and summer is transformed into an outdoor hockey rink, a practical adaptation in a country where winter sports are not seasonal diversions but part of the sporting fabric. In March, before the thaw truly arrives, the stadium hosts hockey games under lights, long before football boots return to the grass.

It is into that environment that Alan Carleton arrives - during the quiet months, during preseason, when adaptation happens away from matchday noise. In Sandviken, there is time to settle, time to work, and little room for distraction before the Superettan calendar resumes in the spring.

## The Club and the League

Sandvikens IF competes in Superettan, Sweden’s second division and the gateway to the top-flight Allsvenskan. Superettan is fully professional and physically demanding, with matches often shaped by transitions, set pieces, and game-state management rather than prolonged possession.

Superettan follows Sweden’s traditional spring-to-fall calendar. The season typically begins in late March and runs through early November, followed by a long winter break during which clubs conduct preseason preparation.

Sandvikens IF earned promotion to Superettan after winning Ettan Norra in 2023, returning to the second tier for the first time since 2011. The club has since completed two full Superettan seasons, finishing sixth in 2024 and tenth in 2025, establishing itself as a stable second-division side.

During the 2025 season, Sandvikens most frequently lined up in a 4-2-3-1, with occasional shifts into a compact 4-3-3. The midfield setup was consistent across matches, with two deep players screening the back line, and a single advanced midfielder positioned higher between the lines.

Defensively, Sandvikens typically deployed narrow blocks that protected central areas and applied pressure in transition. Match flow frequently turned on transitional moments and set pieces, while attacking sequences favored quick progression into advanced areas rather than extended circulation in deeper zones.

## Alan’s Arrival

 Carleton joins Sandvikens IF as a first-team signing during the winter offseason, arriving in Sweden at a point in the calendar when preparation takes precedence over competition. The move places him in Sandviken during the quiet months, when squads are assembled and new players are introduced away from matchday pressure.

It is a transition into a new league and a new country, but also into a new training environment shaped by winter conditions and a spring-to-fall competitive schedule. Daily work centers on physical conditioning and tactical instruction, with preseason matches in February and March providing the first opportunities to translate training into minutes.

Carleton’s first training session came immediately, under winter conditions unfamiliar to him. Speaking after the session, he described the tempo and environment as a contrast to what he had known before.

The conditions were harder to ignore. "The cold", he said, "was unlike anything he had experienced before."

Sandvikens consistently deploys a single advanced central midfielder. The role is asked to support attacking phases through late runs, contribute in transition, and maintain defensive responsibility in central areas. Carleton joins preseason competition for that position, entering a role defined by structure and clear expectations.

Carleton joins Sandvikens IF on a three-year contract, becoming the club’s first new signing ahead of the 2026 season. The move marks his first professional spell outside the United States after progressing through Atlanta United’s system and spending the past season with Huntsville City FC.

On the signing: 
{% include quote.html
   quote="He is a technically skilled player with a good understanding of the game. His point is in the surface in front of the opponents' back line with quirky one-sticks, a sharp finish and a very nice technique.  We believe that his cutting edge qualities combined with his personality will be a good match with our way of playing and training."

Beyond the pitch, Sandvikens places emphasis on off-field integration for young players arriving from various countries. Club director Anders Eriksson noted that the club’s development model extends into daily life, with players included in community and school programs as part of their introduction to the city. The aim, he said, is to help players feel established both within the team and within Sandviken itself, creating conditions that support performance over time.
