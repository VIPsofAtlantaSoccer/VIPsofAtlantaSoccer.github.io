Alex Tambakis has signed with FC Tulsa, adding one of the most decorated goalkeepers in USL Championship history to a club that has prioritized defensive structure over recent seasons.

The move pairs a veteran goalkeeper whose career has been defined by workload and durability with a Tulsa side that leaned heavily on organization and game management during its 2025 playoff run.

## From Atlanta’s First Signing to a USL Career

Tambakis holds a permanent place in Atlanta United history. In January 2016, he became the first player ever signed by the club, nearly a year before Atlanta United played a competitive MLS match.

Initially loaned to the Charleston Battery while Atlanta built itself up, and later anchored ATLUTD 2. 

His time in Atlanta preceded a career spent largely in the USL Championship as a regular starter, playing for North Carolina FC, Sporting Kansas City II, and New Mexico United.. Across those stops, he was utilized as a first-choice goalkeeper in environments that placed high-volume demands on the position.

## Career and Statistical Profile

He enters the 2026 season as the USL Championship’s all-time regular-season leader saves (655) and shutouts (58).

Those totals were accumulated in teams that regularly conceded territory and shots. Tambakis has spent much of his career in matches where the goalkeeper is required to manage repeated defensive actions over extended periods.

Alex was consistently a starter during his five seasons with New Mexico United. In 2025, he earned a Save of the Year nomination for a double-save sequence against Miami FC, reflecting the match environments he regularly faced.

His final season with **New Mexico** concluded against FC Tulsa, who defeated United 3–0 in the 2025 Western Conference Final.

His reputation across the league has been built on availability and consistency. He has been trusted to navigate long stretches of the season, absorb pressure, and maintain performance even when structural protection fluctuated.

## FC Tulsa

FC Tulsa has gradually shaped its identity around tactical discipline. Since the 2020 rebrand, the club has leaned into pragmatic game management rather than high-risk attacking approaches.

That approach produced results in 2025, when Tulsa’s defensive structure anchored a postseason run that set future expectations for the club. Adding Tambakis fits this trajectory. For the Tulsa front office, the signing is as much about setting new standards as it is about shot-stopping.

>Alex is a legendary figure in this league because of how consistently he performs and how much trust he brings to the group in front of him.  His experience, leadership, and mentality raise everyone's level.
<cite>FC Tulsa Sporting Director and General Manager Caleb Sewell</cite>

For Tulsa, the signing provides predictability at a position where errors carry immense weight. Tambakis arrives with a comprehensive understanding of the league’s requirements over a full USL calendar.

## Tulsa

FC Tulsa compete in the USL Championship and play their home matches at ONEOK Field, a downtown ballpark located in the Greenwood District of Tulsa.

**ONEOK Field** seats over 9,100 for soccer and is shared with Minor League Baseball’s Tulsa Drillers. The stadium sits within walking distance of the city’s central business district and is surrounded by ongoing residential and commercial redevelopment. Matchdays place players in a compact, urban setting rather.

Tulsa itself is a mid-sized city with a population of roughly 410,000 and a metropolitan area approaching one million residents.

This move aligns with how Tambakis has been utilized throughout his career. He has been used primarily in high-responsibility, high-volume roles.

For FC Tulsa, the signing reinforces an existing defensive identity. For Tambakis, it provides an environment where reliability remains the central requirement. The move reflects timing and roster needs on both sides.
