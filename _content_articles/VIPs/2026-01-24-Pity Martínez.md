Pity Martínez, 32, has joined Argentina's Club Atlético Tigre after his River Plate contract expired at the end of December 2025.  The move keeps him in the Buenos Aires region, close to the clubs and stadiums where his early career took place.

**Tigre** confirmed the agreement in January 2026, signing Martínez to a one-year contract through December 31 under manager Diego Dabove for the Liga Profesional de Fútbol campaign.  The deal, structured around productivity incentives, offers Martínez a chance at regular competition and to regain form after a string of injuries.

## Injuries and Fitness

Since leaving Atlanta for **Al-Nassr** in 2020, Pity has been plagued by significant injuries, with availability becoming the exception rather than the rule. 

His first season away began modestly, with a short muscle injury, before a major rupture followed in March 2021. That anterior cruciate ligament tear sidelined him for nearly nine months and marked the first major injury of his post-Atlanta career. He returned and found form again, though with reduced explosiveness. While rebuilding fitness in early 2023, Martínez suffered another cruciate ligament tear, keeping him out for more than six months. It was during that recovery period that he transferred to River Plate.

His 2023 campaign was shaped by muscle issues tied to return-to-play management, before a third long-term ligament injury in January 2024 sidelined him for most of the year.   Availability remained elusive in 2025 - four separate muscle injuries cost him 25 matches in total. It was during this stretch that River’s staff informed him he was free to move once his contract expired.

At **Tigre**, the expectation is a more controlled approach: shorter runs of consecutive matches and deliberate recovery cycles designed to preserve continuity across the season.

## Club Atlético Tigre

Club Atlético Tigre is a mid-sized Argentine club based in Victoria, in the northern suburbs of Buenos Aires. Founded in 1902, **Tigre** has spent much of its existence moving between the country’s top two divisions and currently competes in the **Primera División**. The club plays its home matches at **Estadio José Dellagiovanna**, a compact venue with a capacity of roughly 26,000.  Surrounded by residential streets and without parking infrastructure, **Tigre** functions as a neighborhood club on matchdays - supporters arrive on foot, filtering in from nearby blocks.

Tigre has never won a **Primera División** league title, and silverware is rare. Its most notable modern success came in 2019, when it won the **Copa de la Superliga**, a knockout competition that briefly placed the club in the national spotlight. More representative, however, are the recent promotion and relegation cycles, including a return to the top flight after winning the **Primera Nacional** in 2021.

## Victoria

Victoria is located in the northern suburbs of Greater Buenos Aires. Sitting along the area’s main rail and road routes, it functions more as a large suburb than a separate city. While Victoria itself is modest in scale, the broader municipality is home to roughly 450,000 residents, reflecting the steady outward growth of the metropolitan area.

Club Atlético Tigre’s stadium and training facilities are embedded in that urban fabric - surrounded by low-rise neighborhoods, rail lines, and commuter routes that tie the area directly into the capital. Matchdays feel local and contained, but never isolated from the wider football ecosystem of Buenos Aires.

Martínez arrives at **Tigre** as a technical option and a familiar presence, not as a centerpiece.  This move is about regaining game fitness, staying on the pitch, and remaining a part of Argentine football.

Asked about the move, he framed it simply:
