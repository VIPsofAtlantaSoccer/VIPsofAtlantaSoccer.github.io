Atlanta United have signed veteran forward Sérgio Santos to a contract through the 2026 MLS season with a club option through Dec. 31, 2027. The deal adds a second proven MLS striker behind the projected starter and clarifies how the club intends to manage minutes at the top of the formation. Santos joins as a free agent with seven seasons of league experience and 28 goals plus 14 assists across 169 regular-season and playoff appearances - production that supports immediate rotational use rather than long-term development.

## Where Santos Fits in the Depth Chart

With Emmanuel Latte Lath positioned as the primary No. 9 and Designated Player, Santos is projected to fill the first alternative through the middle. He should serve as a like-for-like runner who can press center backs, attack space behind a high line, and close games with pace.

Santos sits ahead of Cayman Togashi in the striker pecking order because his MLS history shows repeatable off-the-ball movement in transition. While Togashi offers size and physical presence, Santos provides earlier entry into competitive matches when tempo and pressing triggers must be maintained. Latte Lath to start, Santos as primary relief, Togashi as situational depth. Importantly, Santos will occupy a Supplemental Roster spot, preserving cap space for other needs.

## What His MLS Track Record Suggests

Santos’ prior stops with **Philadelphia**, **Cincinnati**, and **Houston** show that he scores when deployed into space and benefits from quick vertical service. In Philadelphia’s 2020 Supporters’ Shield season, his movement complemented direct wing play and secondary runners arriving late into the box. In Cincinnati’s 2023 Shield campaign, he functioned as a change-of-pace forward who stretched lines late in matches.  When the midfield wins the ball and releases early, Santos’ first movement is diagonal and aggressive, forcing center backs to turn. 

Santos’ injury history does contain recurring lower-body issues, including leg and muscle strains that limited his 2025 campaign. While there are no documented long-term layoffs, his high-intensity style means he may require load management. By utilizing him in a rotational role, the staff can maximize his "verticality" in 20-30 minute bursts where he is most effective.

## What This Means for 2026

Santos gives the staff a direct substitute who preserves the vertical threat of the starting No. 9. If the match requires immediate pressing and counterattacking speed, he is the first call off the bench. If rotation becomes necessary during congested stretches, he can start without forcing wingers or attacking midfielders into unnatural central roles.

Because his movement profile mirrors Latte Lath’s, internal competition becomes practical. If the starter’s output dips, Santos offers a like-for-like alternative who is ready to stake a claim.
