Before **Soccer Down Here** became part of the daily rhythm for soccer fans across Atlanta - before it became something you could reliably queue up with morning coffee or a commute - Jon Nelson had already spent most of his professional life telling sports stories rooted elsewhere.

His work took him through a wide range of assignments, from Super Bowls, World Series, and Olympic events to national political conventions and weeknight studio shows.

At the same time, a large part of his work stayed much closer to home. Through **Georgia Public Broadcasting**, Nelson became a familiar presence in high school sports coverage across the state, including **Football Fridays in Georgia** and **GHSA** championship broadcasts. Those nights didn’t revolve around visiting stars or national narratives. They revolved around small towns, schools, and programs that came back into focus year after year.

Some weeks meant preparing for a nationally televised broadcast with a narrow window and a fixed script. Other weeks meant returning to the same communities, talking to the same coaches, and following stories that unfolded over years rather than minutes.

Nelson’s own roots mirror that consistency. He attended Lakeside High School in Atlanta and later earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from Florida State University. His early professional years included work in Atlanta newsrooms at **WAGA-TV** and **WGCL-TV**, where daily television set the pace and clarity mattered more than flourish.

Away from the camera, that same interest in documenting sports culture has taken written form. Nelson has authored several books focused on football in Georgia and the Southeast, reflecting the same pull toward place, community, and stories that grow over time.

By the time soccer became central to his work, Nelson’s personality had room to show through. The preparation was visible. So was the time - hours spent on air, welcoming guests, and staying engaged in conversations that didn’t rush toward a takeaway. The steady pace, the ease with long discussions, and the consistency of showing up day after day gave the coverage a sense of enjoyment as much as commitment, built to be returned to rather than consumed once and forgotten.

## Finding Soccer - and Atlanta’s Shift ##

For much of Jon Nelson’s career, soccer lived on the margins of Southern sports coverage. It surfaced during international tournaments or special events, then slipped back out of view. Fans followed the game closely, but it rarely occupied the same daily space as other sports in the local conversation.

Soccer’s presence in Atlanta had grown in fits and starts for decades. But once **Atlanta United** launched, the shift was immediate. What had once felt intermittent became constant. The focus moved from national teams and distant leagues to a local club. Matches became something people planned around, talked about during the week, and returned to again and again.

That change altered the demands on coverage as much as it changed the experience of being a fan. Soccer could no longer be addressed only in bursts or around major tournaments. It required daily attention, regular context, and voices willing to stay with the story as it unfolded week after week.

For a broadcaster accustomed to translating sports for broad audiences, soccer presented a different kind of challenge. The game moves without interruption. Meaning builds through patterns rather than pauses. Explaining it well depends less on soundbites than on history, familiarity, and patience.

As Atlanta’s relationship with the sport deepened, the need for that kind of coverage became increasingly clear.

## The Birth of Soccer Down Here ##

**Soccer Down Here** launched in January 2017, at a moment when both Atlanta and the media landscape were shifting at the same time. Soccer was becoming a daily conversation in the city, while sports media itself was moving away from fixed broadcast schedules toward on-demand listening.

%}


The show took shape in the space between those worlds. Early descriptions place it as a weekday live program, airing Monday through Friday from 9–11 a.m. Eastern on **BlogTalkRadio**, with overnight rebroadcasts on **ESPN** Coastal radio networks. The original hosting group - Jason Longshore, Jarrett Smith, and Jon Nelson - reflected a mix of soccer-specific knowledge and traditional broadcast experience.

None of that was guaranteed to work. Daily soccer coverage was still uncommon, especially in a region where the audience was growing but unproven. Committing to two hours a day meant betting that interest would sustain itself beyond matchdays, and that listeners would return even when the schedule offered no obvious headline.

From the outset, the commitment was clear. Treating soccer as a daily beat meant showing up even when there was no match to react to or headline to chase. It meant preparation, pacing, and the willingness to fill two hours with context rather than noise.

The tone that developed early set the show apart. Discussions unfolded as conversations rather than performances. Questions were allowed to linger. Disagreement existed without becoming the point. **SDH** talked about global soccer, but didn’t pretend to be London, Madrid, or New York.  The conversation was grounded in how Atlanta fans actually encountered the sport.

The show didn’t frame Atlanta as a city trying to prove it belonged in the soccer conversation. Coverage assumed that fans were already engaged - attending matches, following leagues abroad, and building routines around the sport. The focus wasn’t on introducing soccer to a new audience, but on keeping pace with one that was already there.

For Nelson, the format fit instincts shaped long before **SDH** existed. The rhythm of daily broadcasting, the comfort with long conversations, and the habit of returning to the same subject day after day were already familiar. Soccer Down Here didn’t ask for reinvention. It asked for consistency.

## From Show to Network

By its second year, **Soccer Down Here** was no longer operating like a short-term project. In 2018, when **Atlanta United** announced the broadcast team for **ATL UTD 2**, the club’s release included a specific note about Jon Nelson’s work over the previous year:

> Nelson has spent the past year developing the "**Soccer Down Here**" radio program and network at **OSG Sports** alongside **Longshore** and **Jarrett Smith**.

The same announcement named Nelson as the play-by-play host for **ATL UTD 2**, with **Longshore** serving as color analyst. The description framed Nelson’s role beyond on-air hosting. It pointed to work centered on development, organization, and continuity. **Soccer Down Here** was being described not just as a daily show, but as a project being deliberately built and structured.

That work did not immediately change how the show sounded. **Soccer Down Here** - often referred to as **SDH** - remained a daily program, defined by long conversations and steady pacing. What changed was the attention given to how the show was supported, organized, and sustained.

Over time, that structure made growth possible. SDH expanded beyond a single daily show to include additional podcasts, recurring segments, written content, video, and live broadcasts. What began as one program gradually took on the shape of a broader operation, now commonly referred to as the **SDH Network**. Coverage no longer lived in one time slot or format, but moved across platforms while retaining the same tone and point of view.

Nelson’s role shifted alongside that growth. Today, **SDH**’s staff listings identify him as Chief Operating Officer, a title that reflects responsibilities rarely heard on air: scheduling, coordination, staffing, and the systems required to keep daily content moving. These are the parts listeners don’t hear, but they determine whether a project can show up consistently.

That structure has allowed **Soccer Down Here** to maintain its rhythm through changes in the soccer calendar and shifts in how audiences consume media. What sounds effortless on the air is supported by work that happens well before the microphones turn on.

## Voice, Place, and the Daily Choices

For Jon Nelson, covering soccer every day is less about reacting quickly than deciding carefully. Years spent in traditional broadcasting trained him to understand what airtime can do to a story - how easily urgency can turn into noise, and how repetition can either add clarity or wear a subject thin.

{% include centered_image.html

%}


That background shows up in how he approaches soccer. Rather than treating the sport as a set of disconnected levels, Nelson tends to speak about it as something lived locally and continuously. Youth matches, college programs, grassroots clubs, and professional teams are discussed as part of the same landscape, not separate conversations competing for attention.

Those instincts were shaped long before soccer became his primary focus. Moving between national events and local coverage taught him that scale changes how stories should be told. A Super Bowl demands efficiency. A high school playoff demands patience. Soccer, particularly in the American South, often asks for both at the same time.

Daily coverage turns those instincts into routine. Each show brings the same quiet questions: what deserves time, what needs context, and what can be acknowledged without being inflated. Over time, those decisions accumulate. They form a voice not defined by slogans or positioning, but by consistency - by what is returned to, and what is allowed to pass without being chased.

Listeners may not notice those choices individually, but together they shape how the show feels. Soccer is treated as something to follow over time, not something that needs to be constantly argued into relevance. The tone reflects a broadcaster comfortable letting the game breathe, trusting that understanding grows through repetition rather than volume.

## An Ongoing Project ##

Jon Nelson’s story does not resolve neatly, and it does not need to.

What stands out most is not a single moment, but the continuity. The same broadcaster who learned his craft moving between national stages and local gyms now applies that attention to a sport that rewards patience and memory. Soccer did not replace his earlier work. It absorbed it.

The daily nature of the work matters. Hours on air. Time spent preparing. Conversations allowed to unfold without being rushed toward resolution. The consistency is not accidental. It reflects someone comfortable committing to a long view, trusting that understanding builds through repetition rather than urgency.

Atlanta’s soccer story accelerated quickly once it arrived, but the voice documenting it did not need to catch up. It was already shaped by place, routine, and the discipline of daily work. A daily show became something larger because the effort behind it stayed steady.

That work continues in the same way it always has. Conversations prepared rather than rushed. Time committed before the microphones turn on. A show built to return to, one day at a time.
