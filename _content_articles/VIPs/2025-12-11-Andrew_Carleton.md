Andrew Carleton holds a distinct place in Atlanta United’s history.  
Signed in 2016 as the club’s **first Homegrown Player**, he represented a commitment to developing local talent during the earliest days of the Five Stripes project. He appeared in Atlanta United’s first-ever match, a preseason friendly on February 11, 2017 against Chattanooga FC, where he scored in a 4–0 win.

His career would go on to span **multiple leagues, development systems, and competitive levels**, including MLS, the USL Championship, NISA, and a spell abroad in Costa Rica.

This retrospective focuses on Carleton’s development as a player, the roles he took on across several clubs, and the broader arc of a career shaped by many different competitive settings.

## Early Development and the Homegrown Pathway ##

Carleton joined the Atlanta United academy during the club’s launch period and quickly drew attention within U.S. Soccer’s development system for his creativity, first touch, and attacking instincts. Before entering the professional ranks, he became a consistent presence in the **U.S. Youth National Team setup**, representing the US at the U-15, U-16, U-17, U-18, and U-20 levels.

Carleton’s youth national team résumé includes:

- **U-17 FIFA World Cup (2017)**  
- CONCACAF youth tournaments  
- multiple U-20 camps  

He was a central figure in the 2017 U-17 cycle, contributing goals and assists in a highly talented generation of American prospects.

## Atlanta United ##

His signing on **June 9, 2016** marked the start of Atlanta United’s homegrown pathway, which would eventually produce first-team contributors such as George Bello, Caleb Wiley, Tyler Wolff, and Jackson Conway.


### Progression into the Professional Environment ###

      text="Carleton’s first steps into the professional game came in 2016, when he made several appearances for the Charleston Battery as a youth prospect. When Atlanta United entered MLS the following year, he began integrating into the new club’s professional environment, spending most of 2017 training with the first team and earning limited first-team opportunities."

At just 16 years old, he appeared - and scored - in Atlanta United’s first-ever match, a preseason friendly against Chattanooga FC on February 11, 2017. For an expansion club, this level of trust in a teenager is extremely rare. New MLS teams typically lean heavily on experienced players during their launch period, and teenagers almost never feature in those early fixtures. His involvement highlighted both his status as a top American youth prospect and the club’s early commitment to integrating academy talent.

Carleton made his official MLS debut later that spring, entering against the Houston Dynamo on May 20, 2017, still only 16.

      text="The majority of his competitive action came with Atlanta United 2, which launched in 2018. Between 2018 and 2019, he logged 29 USL Championship appearances, playing over 2,400 minutes and contributing 7 goals and 4 assists. These consistent minutes formed the core of his on-field development, giving him extended opportunities to refine his attacking instincts and adapt to the physical and tactical demands of senior-level play."

His on-field minutes at the MLS level were limited - standard for a young attacker entering a top-level environment - but daily training under **Tata Martino** and later **Frank de Boer** helped shape his professional habits, tactical understanding, and developmental foundation."
    %}


This combined period - MLS exposure paired with substantial USL experience - represented the most structured developmental phase of his career. The 2019 season ultimately became his final year within the Atlanta United system before moving on to new opportunities.

      text="In 2022, Carleton signed with ADR Jicaral Sercoba of Costa Rica’s Liga de Ascenso, making one competitive appearance totaling 45 minutes. Although his time in Costa Rica was brief, the move represented an uncommon step for an American attacking midfielder, offering exposure to a new footballing culture and a league known for its technical emphasis. The stint remains one of the more unusual chapters of his professional journey.
        <br/><br/>
        This period exposed him to new tactical demands, different technical expectations in tight spaces, and a distinct footballing culture built around possession and rhythm.
        <br/><br/>
        While it didn’t work out, it remains one of the most unique chapters in his career; relatively few American players spend time in Central American leagues."

      text="He was regularly used as a connector between midfield and the front line, tasked with advancing possession, breaking lines with his dribbling, and supplying final-third service.  Although Las Vegas struggled collectively during the season, Carleton carved out a consistent role within the squad. His minutes reflected both trust from the coaching staff and his ability to adapt to the physical demands of a league known for high-intensity transitions and open attacking phases. 
      <br/><br/>The Lights’ environment also offered something he had not experienced since his Atlanta United 2 days - a full, uninterrupted season of professional minutes at the USL Championship level. For Carleton, it was an important return to higher-level competition, providing the kind of structure, repetition, and tactical continuity that had been missing in some of his previous stops.
      <br/><br/>His 2023 season in Las Vegas stands as one of the more substantial chapters of his post-Atlanta career: a complete season, a defined role, and a chance to reestablish himself in a competitive second-division league."

## Life After Professional Soccer ##

Though Carleton has not formally announced his retirement, his post-playing years have included a return to youth development through **Fury Performance**, an Atlanta-area training outfit he has been publicly involved with. His work there centers on technical development for young players, allowing him to pass on the skill set and experience he gained across MLS, USL, and international environments.

His role in youth development allows him to stay engaged with the game and channel his experience toward supporting the next generation of players.
