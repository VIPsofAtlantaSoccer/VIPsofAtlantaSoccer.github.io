Atlanta United have completed the sale of Edwin Mosquera to **Independiente Santa Fe**.  The move ends a stretch in which the 24-year-old winger struggled to find sustained minutes and returns him to the Colombian league on a long-term deal.  Mosquera has signed a four-year contract running through December 2029. 

A left-sided wide attacker by trade, Mosquera has often been deployed in narrower or less stable roles over the past two seasons. That pattern continued during his return to Colombia in 2025, when he joined Millonarios FC on loan in search of regular playing time with a club he had grown up watching.

The minutes never fully arrived. Across 15 appearances, eight of them starts, Mosquera logged 774 minutes for Millonarios, spending much of that time as an attacking midfielder rather than on the left wing. The output reflected the change in role: no goals, no assists, 26 shots with five on target. Before that loan, his 2025 minutes with Atlanta United came exclusively off the bench, totaling ten appearances without a start.

Millonarios ultimately agreed to terminate the loan early, opening the door to a permanent move.

## Independiente Santa Fe

Founded in 1941, the Bogotá-based club were the first champions of Colombia’s professional era and remain one of the country’s traditional powers, with multiple league titles and a Copa Sudamericana to their name. New signings tend to be tested quickly, with minutes handed out based on performance.

Home matches are played at Estadio El Campín, officially Estadio Nemesio Camacho, located in the Teusaquillo district of Bogotá. The stadium can hold roughly 39,000 spectators and is shared with Millonarios FC, Santa Fe’s primary rival.

At altitude, the game behaves differently. Bogotá sits at approximately 2,640 meters above sea level, a factor that shapes tempo and recovery. Short, explosive actions carry more weight than sustained high-speed running. For wide players, defensive recovery and positional discipline often determine whether minutes are sustained from match to match, not just attacking output.

Bogotá is the largest city in Colombia and one of the biggest in South America, with more than eight million residents in the capital district and roughly eleven million across the metro area.  It is denser than Atlanta and more geographically compact, operating as the country’s political and financial center at altitude.

Mosquera enters a wide attacking group without a guaranteed long-term starter on the left. The role has rotated over the past year.  The contract length suggests **Santa Fe** see him more than a late sub role. Given his lack of recent starting minutes, Mosquera is likely to begin from the bench, with opportunities tied to how quickly he produces in limited roles.

Atlanta United close the file on a player whose minutes never stabilized. Mosquera arrives at **Santa Fe** without a starting role and without the latitude he once had, in a squad where minutes are earned quickly and kept through performance.
