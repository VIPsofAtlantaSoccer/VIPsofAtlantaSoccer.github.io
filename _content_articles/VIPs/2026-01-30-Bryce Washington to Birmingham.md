Birmingham Legion FC announced the signing of defender Bryce Washington ahead of the 2026 USL Championship season, pending league and federation approval.

Washington becomes available after the conclusion of the 2025 season with **North Carolina FC**, where he spent the previous two years as a regular starter. Following the end of the campaign, **North Carolina** suspended operations for the '26 season, with the aim to return in 2028 as part of the USL’s new Division One setup.  In doing so, they released all players.  That decision opened Washington’s offseason, and **Birmingham** moved to add an experienced center back with an established second-division record.

At 27, Washington joins The Legion with extensive experience in the USL Championship, shaped by multiple full seasons under the league’s physical, tactical, and travel demands.

## From Academy to the Professional Game

Born in Atlanta and standing 6-foot-2, he developed in the Atlanta United Academy before taking a longer collegiate path through Rutgers University and the University of Pittsburgh. At Pitt, he was a regular starter at center back, logging heavy minutes from 2019 to 2021 and helping anchor a defense that reached the **NCAA College Cup**.

After college, Washington returned to Atlanta as a Homegrown signing and spent two seasons with ATLUTD2, where he accumulated steady professional minutes and adjusted to the demands of the senior game. That foundation carried him into the USL Championship with Loudoun United, marking the start of a sustained run as a regular second-division starter.

The following year, Washington moved to **North Carolina FC**.  There, he was used consistently across league and playoff matches, handling first contact in the box, organizing defensive sequences, and staying involved through buildup rather than dropping out of play after clearances.  His game was built around holding shape, winning initial duels, and moving possession safely into the next phase.

## Birmingham

The signing addresses a defensive reset for Birmingham Legion after a difficult 2025 season which saw them finish last in the East. Birmingham conceded 50 goals in 30 matches, a campaign shaped by inconsistency across the back line and frequent defensive turnover during matches.

The Legion enter 2026 with a need to replace a significant portion of their defensive core, including long-time starter Jake Rufe, regular contributors Stephen Turnbull and Tiago Suárez, and depth pieces Moses Mensah and Ethan Kos. The retirement of goalkeeper Trevor Spangenberg further reshapes the defensive structure in front of goal.

Physically, Washington addresses specific areas where The Legion struggled last season. The Legion finished the season winning 48.2% of total duels, 45.6% of aerial duels, and 66.3% of tackles. At **North Carolina**, Washington had higher success rates across all three, indicating a defender more likely to win first contact and resolve defensive sequences earlier rather than allowing extended pressure.

That difference supports a back line asked to contest space higher up the field instead of retreating into sustained defensive phases. Washington’s involvement in duels and aerial challenges aligns with an effort to reduce second balls and limit repeated entries into the box.

Tactically, Washington gives **Birmingham** coverage in multiple defensive positions. His ability to operate across the back line allows the staff to deploy him centrally or shift him wider when injuries or matchups require adjustment.
